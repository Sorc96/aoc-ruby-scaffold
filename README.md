# Advent of code - Ruby scaffolding

## Solve a challenge

- Save the input in `input/{year}/{day}` (`input/2022/1`)
- Create the implementation in `lib/aoc{year}/day{day}.rb` (`lib/aoc2022/day1.rb`)
- After checking the correctness of the solution, add it as a test in `test/aoc{year}_test.rb` (`test/aoc2022_test.rb`) as `[{day}, {part}] => expected` (`[1, :a] => 42`)

## Run the code

Use the `./aoc` command to run the challenges, run tests, or enter the interactive mode.
